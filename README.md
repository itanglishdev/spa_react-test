# SPA React Test

## Environment

This test is consisted of six tasks split into separate folders.

### Each task folder contains

- `README.md` file about the target task
- Basic React boilerplate
- Some tasks have CSS with basic styling
- Tasks titles in `README.md` are hyperlinks. You can use them as a hint about what you might need to slove the corresponding task.

## How to start?

1. Clone the repo
2. You can open the task that you want to solve individually with your vs code
3. Install dependencies for each individual task; `npm install`
4. Start coding

## Notes

- Focus on functionality, NOT style
- We accept unfinished tasks; don't delete the code you wrote
- When committing and pushing, make sure are in the main directory to commit and push everything
- You can push multiple times, even after each separate task
- Push your code within the given test duration, better to be a bit early
